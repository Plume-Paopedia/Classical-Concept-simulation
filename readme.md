## Usage

## Code Explanation

The `script.js` file contains the main logic for the simulator. It defines a list of shapes and answers, and a function `myfunction()` that generates a random shape and answer when called. The function also updates the UI with the generated shape and answer, and starts a timer. The user can click on the elements in the UI to guess the answer, and the function checks if the guess is correct.

The `style.css` file contains the styles for the simulator. It defines the layout of the simulator using CSS Grid, the styles for the shapes and the container that holds them, and the styles for the cross and chain elements.
